# sending-mail-using-python-smtplib
Here in this repository. I have added the notebook for sending the automatic mail when some execution finishes or just to use automatic mailing using python smtplib library. It will send automatic mail to the desired email address in html format or just simple message.

## Here in this notebook You can modify the message according to your need. If you know HTML you can send the format the email as you want using simple html tags in the message.
